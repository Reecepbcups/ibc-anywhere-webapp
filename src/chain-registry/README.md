## Chain Registry

I had some issues getting my fork to work and import (TS/npm noob). This is a simple 'hacky' solution to get the objects to import correctly.

git clone reecepbcups/chain-registry-ts

generate latest from the chain-registry submodule

copy the chain-registry/src/*.ts files to this area.
